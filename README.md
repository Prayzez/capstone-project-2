# capstone-project-2
Capstone Project 2 - I created a personal website with resume, contact and other things only using HTML and CSS. We were not allowed to use Bootstrap and at this point in time I hadn't learned JS yet, so the top right "button" on the mobile version doesn't work. As I progress and level up, so will my personal website.
